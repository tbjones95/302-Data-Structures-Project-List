Project 8

The assignment for project 9 was introduction to Heap data structures. My assignment was to implement two functions, the insert and removal functions. In order for me to correctly finsish my assignment, my professor provided me with all the rest of the supporting functions and classes. The heap in which we were creating was a min heap.
