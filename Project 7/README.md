Project 7

The assignment for project 7 was an add to project 6. Project 6 consisted of a more basic binary search tree; however, for Project 7 the assignment was to add more functionality to create a more complex binary tree. Some of these functions consisted of finding width at a given row, determining whether or not the tree was complete or full, and being able to delete a given node. In order to complete this task my professor also included a input file, main driver, and a header file consiting of all the functions needed to implement.
