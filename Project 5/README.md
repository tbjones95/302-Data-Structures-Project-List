Project 4

My taskes for project 5 are very similar to those of project 4. The difference with project 5 has me designing two different sorting classes. The first sorting class will be designed to take a given vector and sort given dates by using a merge sort. The second sorting class will do the same as the first; however, instead of a merge sort the dates will be sorted by using a quick sort. Along with dealing with sorting algorithms, my designed class has to inherit a simple sort class which also inherits the simple vector class. I have been given the class files named "SimpleVector", "DataType", and "SorterClass", which have been writen by my professor Micheal Leverington. My part of the project to design and implement the MrgSorter and QkSorter classes which will hold the tools in order to correctly sort the vector. Professor Leverington also gave us a main driver, named "PA055" which will be used to test both of my sorting classes.
