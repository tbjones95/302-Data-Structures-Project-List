Project 1

My taskes for project 1 was to design a node list. I was given the header file named "LinkedList.h" and "ListNode.h", which was writen by my professor Micheal Leverington. My part of the project is to implement both these classes in their corresponding source files. Professor Leverington also has given me a main driver which can be used to test my node list class.
