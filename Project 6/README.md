Project 6

The assignment for project 6 was to take the header file "BSTClass_PublicMethods.h", which was provided by my professor, and convert it to a templated header file in which would work for a binary search tree.The binary search tree had to be templated to hold a name type data structure which was writen in NameType files included in the repository. My professor also included five different input files in which held names along with a main driver to test our project out.
