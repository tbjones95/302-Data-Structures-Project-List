My taskes for project 2 was to design a my own simple vector class. I was given the header file named "SimpleVector.H", which was writen by my professor Micheal Leverington. My part of the project to implement the vector classes source files. Professor Leverington also gave us a main driver, named "PA02.cpp" which was used to test our vector class.
