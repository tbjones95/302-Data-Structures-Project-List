Project 2

My taskes for project 2 have me designing my own simple vector class. I have been given the header file named "SimpleVector.H", which was writen by my professor Micheal Leverington. My part of the project is to implement the vector classes source files. Professor Leverington has also given me a main driver, named "PA02.cpp" which can be used to test my vector class.
